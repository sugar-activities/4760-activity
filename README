Creating a CrossWord
--------------------

You can create a crossword in two ways:

1 - From the activity:
Select "New Game" from the toolbar and enter the words you want to be part of the crossword in the area on the right using the spacebar to create voids.

Write the clues in the area on the left, depending if your word is to be placed in the grid vertically or horizontally, with the following syntax:

Box number of the first letter of the word - Definition

An example:
5 - An example definition

Finally, select the "Save game" option and choose the path to save his departure. If no selection completion ".cwg", this will be added to the file name.

2 - From a text editor (externally activity):
With a text editor, create a file and save it with the extension ".cwg" in the path you want.

You must respect the following syntax if you choose this option:
You must create the three mandatory sections, regardless the order in which they are created: "Horizontals", "Verticals" and "Game".
In the "Horizontals" and "Verticals" sections, you should write the grid number of the word, followed by a colon, and the definition of the word.
In the "Game" section, you should write the numbers 1 to 10, followed by a colon, and these followed by the letters of each line of the puzzle, to represent a space, use the character "/".
A more practical example of the syntax to use:

[Horizontals]
1: A sign
2: Other sign

[Verticals]
1: The best sign
4: Another sign

[Game]
1: T H I S / / / / / /
2: I S / / / / / / / /
3: A N / / / / / / / /
4: E X A M P L E / / /
5: O F / / / / / / / /
6: C R O S S W O R D /
7: / / / / / / / / / /
8: T H E / / / / / / /
9: B E S T / / / / / /
10: C R O S S W O R D /
